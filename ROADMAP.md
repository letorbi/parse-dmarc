## Our Users

Understanding who we're building for shapes every decision. Parse DMARC serves several distinct personas:

### The Solo Developer
- **Context**: Runs multiple side projects, each with its own domain
- **Pain Point**: No time to learn email authentication intricacies; just wants things to work
- **Need**: Set-and-forget solution with instant visibility when something goes wrong
- **Success Metric**: Protected in under 5 minutes, never thinks about DMARC again until needed

### The Startup Engineer
- **Context**: Building a SaaS product, sending transactional and marketing emails
- **Pain Point**: Email deliverability issues affecting customer experience; no budget for enterprise tools
- **Need**: Comprehensive monitoring without the Elasticsearch/Kibana complexity
- **Success Metric**: Full visibility into email authentication, catches issues before customers complain

### The Security Engineer
- **Context**: Protecting organization's domain from spoofing and phishing attacks
- **Pain Point**: Aggregate reports are unreadable; can't detect attacks in real-time
- **Need**: Threat intelligence, alerting, forensic analysis capabilities
- **Success Metric**: Detects and responds to spoofing attempts within minutes

### The MSP/Agency
- **Context**: Managing email security for dozens or hundreds of client domains
- **Pain Point**: No unified view across clients; manual report checking doesn't scale
- **Need**: Multi-tenant dashboard, white-labeling, automated reporting
- **Success Metric**: Manages 100+ domains from a single pane of glass

### The Enterprise IT Team
- **Context**: Large organization with complex email infrastructure
- **Pain Point**: Compliance requirements, audit trails, integration with existing security stack
- **Need**: SSO, RBAC, SIEM integration, comprehensive audit logging
- **Success Metric**: Passes security audits, integrates with existing tooling

---

## Design Principles

Every feature we build adheres to these principles:

### 1. Zero-to-Protected in Minutes
The time from "I heard about DMARC" to "my domain is monitored" should be measured in minutes, not hours. Every friction point is a failure.

### 2. Actionable, Not Just Informational
Data without context is noise. Every metric, alert, and visualization should answer "so what?" and ideally "what should I do about it?"

### 3. Complexity is Optional
Simple use cases should feel simple. Advanced features should be discoverable but never in the way. A solo developer and an enterprise security team should both feel at home.

### 4. Works Where You Work
Parse DMARC should integrate into existing workflows—Slack, Prometheus, CI/CD pipelines—rather than demanding users change how they work.

### 5. Trust Through Transparency
As a security tool, we must be transparent about what we do, how we handle data, and what our limitations are. Open source isn't just our license; it's our philosophy.

## Feature Details

### Phase 1 Features

#### 1.1 Dark Mode

**Context**: Dark mode has evolved from a nice-to-have to a baseline expectation in 2025. Developers especially prefer dark interfaces, and DMARC monitoring often happens during incident response when eye strain matters.

**User Story**: As a user working late investigating an email issue, I want a dark interface option so that I can work comfortably without straining my eyes.

**Scope**:
- System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Manual toggle with persistence (localStorage)
- Smooth transition animations
- Consistent color palette across all components
- Proper contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA)

**Technical Notes**:
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Single source of truth for color tokens
- Consider both light-on-dark and dark-on-light contrast needs

---

#### 1.2 DNS Record Generator

**Context**: The #1 barrier to DMARC adoption is the complexity of creating correct DNS records. Users must understand TXT record syntax, policy options, and reporting addresses. A generator eliminates this friction entirely.

**User Story**: As a new user, I want Parse DMARC to generate the exact DNS record I need so that I can copy-paste it into my DNS provider without learning DMARC syntax.

**Scope**:
- Interactive form for DMARC policy options:
  - Policy level (none/quarantine/reject)
  - Subdomain policy
  - Percentage
  - Alignment modes (relaxed/strict)
  - Reporting addresses (rua/ruf)
  - Reporting interval
- Real-time preview of generated record
- Copy-to-clipboard with visual feedback
- Provider-specific instructions (Cloudflare, Route53, GoDaddy, etc.)
- Validation of email addresses
- Explanation of each option in plain English

**Example Output**:
```
_dmarc.yourdomain.com TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; pct=100; adkim=r; aspf=r"
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Client-side generation (no server needed)
- Consider generating SPF records too as a bonus

---

#### 1.3 Compliance Health Score

**Context**: A single number (0-100) that represents overall email authentication health is instantly understandable by anyone—executives, developers, or security teams. It gamifies improvement and simplifies communication.

**User Story**: As a domain owner, I want a single score representing my email authentication health so that I can quickly understand my status and track improvement over time.

**Scope**:
- Score calculation algorithm considering:
  - DMARC pass rate (primary factor)
  - SPF alignment rate
  - DKIM alignment rate
  - Policy strictness (reject > quarantine > none)
  - Volume of authenticated traffic
- Visual representation (circular gauge, letter grade)
- Color coding (green/yellow/red zones)
- Trend indicator (improving/declining/stable)
- Breakdown of contributing factors
- Historical score tracking

**Scoring Framework**:
```
Base Score = (DMARC Pass Rate × 0.5) + (SPF Pass Rate × 0.25) + (DKIM Pass Rate × 0.25)
Policy Multiplier = { reject: 1.0, quarantine: 0.9, none: 0.7 }
Final Score = Base Score × Policy Multiplier × 100
```

---

#### 1.4 Data Export

**Context**: Users need to share DMARC data with stakeholders, import into other tools, or archive for compliance. Export functionality is table stakes for any monitoring tool.

**User Story**: As a security engineer, I want to export DMARC data in standard formats so that I can include it in reports, analyze in spreadsheets, or archive for compliance.

**Scope**:
- Export formats:
  - CSV (for spreadsheets)
  - JSON (for programmatic use)
  - PDF (for reports) - Phase 2
- Export scopes:
  - All reports
  - Filtered reports (date range, domain, etc.)
  - Single report detail
  - Statistics summary
- Column selection for CSV
- Date range filtering
- Immediate download (no email required)

**Technical Notes**:
- Client-side generation for CSV/JSON (faster, no server load)
- Consider streaming for large exports
- Include metadata (export date, filters applied)

---

#### 1.5 Keyboard Shortcuts

**Context**: Power users live by keyboard shortcuts. They signal a mature, thoughtfully-designed application and dramatically improve efficiency for frequent users.

**User Story**: As a power user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common actions so that I can navigate and operate the dashboard without reaching for my mouse.

**Scope**:
- Global shortcuts:
  - `r` - Refresh data
  - `/` or `Cmd+K` - Focus search/filter
  - `?` - Show keyboard shortcut help
  - `Esc` - Close modal/clear focus
- Navigation:
  - `j/k` - Navigate through report list
  - `Enter` - Open selected report
  - `g h` - Go to home/dashboard
- Help modal showing all shortcuts
- Shortcuts should not conflict with browser defaults
- Visible hints in UI (tooltips showing shortcuts)

**Technical Notes**:
- Use a lightweight library or native event handling
- Ensure shortcuts don't fire when typing in inputs
- Consider customization in future

---

#### 1.6 ASN/Organization Enrichment

**Context**: Raw IP addresses are meaningless to most users. Showing "AS15169 - Google LLC" instead of "172.217.164.110" provides instant context about whether a sender is legitimate.

**User Story**: As a user reviewing sending sources, I want to see organization names instead of just IP addresses so that I can quickly identify legitimate senders vs. suspicious ones.

**Scope**:
- Resolve IP → ASN → Organization name
- Display in:
  - Top sending sources table
  - Report detail view
  - Tooltips on IP addresses
- Caching to minimize lookups
- Graceful degradation when lookup fails
- Data sources:
  - MaxMind GeoLite2 ASN database (free)
  - Or ipinfo.io API (freemium)

**Example Display**:
```
172.217.164.110
Google LLC (AS15169)
Mountain View, US
```

---

#### 1.7 Compliance Badge

**Context**: Dynamic badges in README files are a powerful growth mechanism. Developers love showing off their infrastructure quality, and every badge is free advertising for Parse DMARC.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a dynamic badge showing my domain's DMARC compliance so that I can display it in my README and demonstrate my commitment to email security.

**Scope**:
- Dynamic SVG badge endpoint: `/badge/{domain}.svg`
- Badge styles:
  - shields.io compatible format
  - Flat, flat-square, for-the-badge styles
- Shows compliance percentage and/or letter grade
- Color coded (green >90%, yellow >70%, red <70%)
- Caching for performance
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Optional: require API key for private data

**Example**:
```markdown
![DMARC Compliance](https://your-instance.com/badge/example.com.svg)
```

**Security Consideration**: Consider whether compliance data should be public. May require opt-in or API key.

---

#### 1.8 Manual Report Upload

**Context**: Not everyone uses IMAP. Some users receive reports via other channels, want to test with sample data, or are evaluating Parse DMARC before configuring email access.

**User Story**: As a user without IMAP access, I want to upload DMARC XML files directly so that I can use Parse DMARC without configuring email integration.

**Scope**:
- Drag-and-drop upload zone
- Support formats:
  - Raw XML files
  - Gzip compressed (.xml.gz)
  - ZIP archives
- Multiple file upload
- Progress indication
- Duplicate detection (skip already-imported reports)
- Validation with helpful error messages
- Success confirmation with link to view report

**Technical Notes**:
- Reuse existing parser code
- Consider file size limits
- Add rate limiting for public instances

---

### Phase 2 Features

#### 2.1 Smart Alerting System

**Context**: A dashboard you have to check manually isn't monitoring—it's a chore. Real monitoring means being notified when something needs attention, without drowning in noise.

**User Story**: As a domain owner, I want to receive alerts when something important happens with my email authentication so that I can respond quickly to issues without constantly checking the dashboard.

**Scope**:
- Alert channels:
  - Email (via SMTP configuration)
  - Slack (webhook integration)
  - Discord (webhook integration)
  - Microsoft Teams (webhook integration)
  - Generic webhooks (for custom integrations)
- Alert types:
  - Compliance dropped below threshold
  - New sending source detected
  - Sudden volume spike/drop
  - Authentication failure rate increase
  - First report from new domain
- Configuration:
  - Per-channel settings
  - Alert frequency limits (no more than X per hour)
  - Quiet hours
  - Threshold customization
- Alert history and acknowledgment

**Example Alert**:
```
🚨 DMARC Alert: example.com

Compliance dropped from 98% to 72% in the last 24 hours.

Top failure source: 192.168.1.100 (Unknown - AS12345)
Failed messages: 1,247

View details: https://your-instance.com/reports?domain=example.com
```

---

#### 2.2 Historical Trend Charts

**Context**: Point-in-time metrics don't tell the story. Trends reveal whether you're improving, degrading, or stable—and help justify security investments to stakeholders.

**User Story**: As a security engineer, I want to see how my email authentication metrics have changed over time so that I can track improvement, detect gradual degradation, and report on progress.

**Scope**:
- Time-series charts for:
  - Compliance rate over time
  - Email volume trends
  - Pass/fail breakdown
  - Top senders over time
- Time range selection:
  - Last 7 days
  - Last 30 days
  - Last 90 days
  - Custom range
- Granularity options (daily, weekly)
- Multi-domain comparison
- Export charts as images
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Technical Notes**:
- Use a lightweight charting library (Chart.js, Apache ECharts)
- Aggregate data in database for performance
- Consider data retention implications

---

#### 2.3 Interactive GeoIP Map

**Context**: A world map showing where emails originate provides instant visual insight that tables cannot match. Geographic anomalies (emails from unexpected countries) become immediately obvious.

**User Story**: As a security analyst, I want to see a geographic visualization of email sources so that I can quickly identify suspicious activity from unexpected locations.

**Scope**:
- Interactive world map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap)
- Features:
  - Markers/bubbles sized by volume
  - Color coding by authentication result
  - Click to drill down by country/region
  - Hover for details (country, volume, pass rate)
- Filtering:
  - By domain
  - By date range
  - By authentication result
- Heat map mode for high-volume data
- List view toggle for accessibility

**Technical Notes**:
- MaxMind GeoLite2 City database for IP geolocation
- Cluster markers at low zoom levels
- Consider WebGL for large datasets

---

#### 2.4 DNS Record Validator

**Context**: Many DMARC issues stem from misconfigured DNS records—syntax errors, missing components, conflicting policies. Proactive validation catches problems before they cause failures.

**User Story**: As a domain administrator, I want Parse DMARC to validate my DNS records and alert me to misconfigurations so that I can fix issues before they affect deliverability.

**Scope**:
- Validate records for:
  - DMARC (_dmarc.domain.com)
  - SPF (domain.com TXT)
  - DKIM (selector._domainkey.domain.com)
- Validation checks:
  - Syntax correctness
  - Policy consistency
  - SPF record length (<255 chars, <10 DNS lookups)
  - DKIM key validity
  - Common mistakes detection
- Plain-English explanations of issues
- Severity levels (error, warning, info)
- Recommendations for fixes
- Scheduled periodic checks with alerting
- Manual on-demand validation

**Example Output**:
```
✅ DMARC: Valid
   Policy: reject | Alignment: relaxed

⚠️ SPF: Warning
   Record valid but approaching 10 DNS lookup limit (8/10)
   Recommendation: Consider flattening your SPF record

❌ DKIM: Error
   Selector 'google' not found
   Expected: google._domainkey.example.com
```

---

#### 2.5 Remediation Guide

**Context**: Knowing something failed isn't useful without knowing how to fix it. Context-aware remediation guidance transforms Parse DMARC from a diagnostic tool into a solution.

**User Story**: As a user viewing a failed authentication, I want specific guidance on how to fix the issue so that I don't have to research DMARC troubleshooting separately.

**Scope**:
- "Fix This" button on failed records
- Context-aware recommendations based on:
  - Failure type (SPF, DKIM, alignment)
  - Sender identification (known services vs. unknown)
  - Common patterns and known issues
- Guidance categories:
  - Legitimate sender misconfiguration
  - Third-party service setup
  - Potential spoofing/attack
  - DNS configuration issues
- Step-by-step instructions
- Links to relevant documentation
- Provider-specific guides (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, SendGrid, etc.)

**Example**:
```
📧 Failure Analysis

Source: 198.51.100.50 (SendGrid, Inc.)
Issue: SPF alignment failed

This appears to be SendGrid sending on your behalf, but SPF
isn't properly configured.

Fix Steps:
1. Add SendGrid to your SPF record:
   include:sendgrid.net

2. Your new SPF record should be:
   v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net ~all

3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

#### 2.6 IP Reputation Integration

**Context**: An unknown IP sending email as your domain could be a new legitimate service—or an attacker. Reputation data provides immediate context that would otherwise require manual investigation.

**User Story**: As a security analyst, I want to see reputation information for sending IPs so that I can quickly distinguish between legitimate senders and potential threats.

**Scope**:
- Reputation data sources:
  - AbuseIPDB (abuse reports)
  - VirusTotal (malware/phishing associations)
  - Shodan (exposed services) - optional
  - Internal reputation (based on historical data)
- Display elements:
  - Reputation score/badge
  - Known associations (malware, spam, etc.)
  - Abuse report count
  - First/last seen dates
- Visual indicators:
  - 🟢 Clean/trusted
  - 🟡 Suspicious/limited data
  - 🔴 Known bad actor
- Caching to respect rate limits
- Graceful degradation without API keys

**Privacy Note**: Consider opt-in for external API calls that share IP data.

---

#### 2.7 Onboarding Wizard

**Context**: First impressions are permanent. A guided onboarding experience reduces time-to-value, prevents misconfiguration, and demonstrates that Parse DMARC is designed for humans.

**User Story**: As a new user, I want a guided setup experience so that I can get Parse DMARC working correctly without reading extensive documentation.

**Scope**:
- Step-by-step wizard:
  1. Welcome & overview
  2. DNS record setup (with generator)
  3. Email/IMAP configuration
  4. Connection test
  5. First report check
  6. Dashboard tour
- Progress indicator
- Skip option for experienced users

**Technical Notes**:
- Store completion state to not show repeatedly
- Consider video/animation elements
- Mobile-friendly design

---

#### 2.8 Webhook Support

**Context**: Webhooks enable Parse DMARC to be a trigger in larger automation workflows. Security teams can pipe events to SIEM, ticketing systems, or custom automation without polling.

**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want to receive webhook notifications for DMARC events so that I can integrate with my existing automation and monitoring systems.

**Scope**:
- Webhook events:
  - `report.received` - New report processed
  - `compliance.changed` - Compliance threshold crossed
  - `source.new` - New sending source detected
  - `alert.triggered` - Any alert condition met
- Configuration:
  - Multiple webhook endpoints
  - Event filtering per endpoint
  - Custom headers (for auth)
  - Secret for payload signing (HMAC)
- Features:
  - Retry with exponential backoff
  - Delivery logging
  - Manual test/ping
  - Payload preview

**Payload Example**:
```json
{
  "event": "compliance.changed",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-28T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "domain": "example.com",
    "previous_compliance": 98.5,
    "current_compliance": 72.3,
    "period": "24h",
    "top_failure_source": "192.168.1.100"
  }
}
```

---

### Phase 3 Features

#### 3.1 Authentication System

**Context**: Production deployments need access control. Without authentication, anyone who can reach the dashboard can view sensitive email security data.

**User Story**: As an administrator, I want to secure access to Parse DMARC so that only authorized users can view and manage email authentication data.

**Scope**:
- Authentication methods:
  - Local username/password
  - OIDC/OAuth2 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
  - SAML (enterprise SSO)
- Features:
  - Secure password hashing (argon2id)
  - Session management
  - Remember me option
  - Password reset flow
  - MFA support (TOTP)
- User management:
  - Invite users via email
  - Disable/enable accounts
  - Password policies

**Technical Notes**:
- Consider using an auth library (ZITADEL, Authelia, or built-in)
- JWT or session-based authentication
- Secure cookie handling

---

#### 3.2 Multi-Organization Support

**Context**: MSPs, agencies, and enterprises manage multiple domains across different clients or business units. A single Parse DMARC instance should support complete data isolation between organizations.

**User Story**: As an MSP, I want to manage multiple clients' DMARC data in a single Parse DMARC instance so that I don't need separate deployments for each client.

**Scope**:
- Organization model:
  - Create/edit/delete organizations
  - Assign domains to organizations
  - Separate IMAP credentials per org
  - Data isolation between orgs
- User-organization relationship:
  - Users belong to one or more orgs
  - Per-org roles
  - Organization switching in UI
- Per-organization settings:
  - Alert configurations
  - Retention policies
  - Branding (Phase 4)
- Global admin view across all orgs

**Database Considerations**:
- Add organization_id to reports/records tables
- Index optimization for multi-tenant queries
- Consider row-level security

---

#### 3.3 Role-Based Access Control

**Context**: Different users need different permissions. Admins configure; analysts investigate; executives view reports. RBAC enables secure delegation.

**User Story**: As an organization admin, I want to assign different permission levels to users so that I can control who can view, edit, or manage Parse DMARC.

**Scope**:
- Built-in roles:
  - **Owner**: Full access, can delete org

  - **Analyst**: View all data, create reports, manage alerts
  - **Viewer**: Read-only dashboard access
- Permissions:
  - View reports
  - Export data
  - Manage alerts
  - Manage users
  - Configure IMAP
  - Access API
- Custom roles (future)
- Role assignment UI
- Audit log of permission changes

---

#### 3.4 Prometheus Metrics

**Context**: DevOps teams expect metrics in Prometheus format for unified observability. Parse DMARC should integrate into existing monitoring stacks rather than requiring separate monitoring.

**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want Parse DMARC to expose Prometheus metrics so that I can monitor it alongside my other infrastructure in Grafana.

**Scope**:
- Metrics endpoint: `/metrics`
- Metrics exposed:
  - `parse_dmarc_reports_total` (counter)
  - `parse_dmarc_messages_total{result="pass|fail"}` (counter)
  - `parse_dmarc_compliance_ratio{domain="..."}` (gauge)
  - `parse_dmarc_sources_unique` (gauge)
  - `parse_dmarc_fetch_duration_seconds` (histogram)
  - `parse_dmarc_fetch_errors_total` (counter)
- Labels for multi-domain filtering
- Standard Go runtime metrics
- Example Grafana dashboard JSON
- AlertManager rule examples

---

#### 3.5 Scheduled Reports

**Context**: Stakeholders who don't check dashboards still need visibility. Scheduled email reports keep everyone informed without requiring login access.

**User Story**: As a security manager, I want to receive scheduled summary reports so that I can keep stakeholders informed without them needing dashboard access.

**Scope**:
- Report types:
  - Daily summary
  - Weekly digest
  - Monthly executive report

---

#### 3.6 Audit Logging

**Context**: Compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001) require audit trails. Even without compliance requirements, knowing who did what and when is essential for security operations.

**User Story**: As a compliance officer, I want a complete audit trail of all actions in Parse DMARC so that I can demonstrate control effectiveness during audits.

**Scope**:
- Logged events:
  - User authentication (login, logout, failed attempts)
  - Configuration changes
  - User management actions
  - Data exports
  - Alert acknowledgments
  - API key creation/revocation
- Log details:
  - Timestamp
  - User/API key
  - Action type
  - Target resource
  - IP address
  - User agent
  - Before/after values (for changes)
- Log viewer in UI
- Export for external SIEM
- Retention configuration

---

#### 3.7 API Keys

**Context**: Programmatic access is essential for automation. API keys enable CI/CD integration, custom tooling, and third-party integrations without exposing user credentials.

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to generate API keys so that I can integrate Parse DMARC with my automation scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

**Scope**:
- API key management:
  - Create with name/description
  - Set expiration (optional)
  - Scope/permission limiting
  - Revoke immediately
  - View last used timestamp
- Security:
  - Keys shown only once at creation
  - Rate limiting per key
  - IP allowlisting (optional)
- Usage:
  - Bearer token authentication
  - Key prefix for identification (pd_live_...)
- Per-organization keys in multi-tenant mode

---

### Phase 4 Features

#### 4.1 AI Assistant

**Context**: DMARC is complex. Understanding why something failed, what it means, and what to do requires expertise. An AI assistant democratizes this expertise.

**User Story**: As a non-expert user, I want to ask questions about my DMARC data in plain English so that I can understand issues without becoming a DMARC expert.

**Scope**:
- Chat interface in dashboard
- Capabilities:
  - Explain what a specific failure means
  - Suggest fixes for common issues
  - Summarize recent activity
  - Answer DMARC/SPF/DKIM questions
  - Compare current state to best practices
- Context-aware (knows your data)
- Example queries:
  - "Why did this email fail?"
  - "Is this IP address legitimate?"
  - "What should I do about my SPF record?"
  - "Summarize last week's authentication issues"
- Privacy: Option to disable, clear data handling

**Technical Notes**:
- Integration with LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Careful prompt engineering for accuracy
- Rate limiting to control costs

---

#### 4.2 Anomaly Detection

**Context**: Manual threshold-based alerts miss subtle attacks. ML-based anomaly detection learns normal patterns and flags deviations humans might miss.

**User Story**: As a security engineer, I want Parse DMARC to automatically detect unusual patterns so that I can catch sophisticated attacks that wouldn't trigger simple threshold alerts.

**Scope**:
- Anomaly types:

#### 4.3 Forensic Reports

**Context**: Aggregate reports (RUA) show statistics; forensic reports (RUF) show individual message details. Complete DMARC support requires both.

**User Story**: As a security analyst investigating an incident, I want access to forensic reports so that I can see individual message details for failed authentications.

**Scope**:
- RUF report parsing
- Display:
  - Individual message headers
  - Authentication details
  - Message timestamps
  - Recipient information
- Privacy controls:
  - Redaction options
  - Retention limits
  - Access restrictions
- Correlation with aggregate reports
- Search by message ID, sender, etc.

**Note**: Forensic reports contain sensitive data. Implementation must prioritize privacy and security.

#### 4.4 Natural Language Queries

**Context**: Traditional filters require knowing the data model. Natural language lets users ask questions like they would ask a colleague.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to query my DMARC data using natural language so that I don't need to learn filter syntax.

**Scope**:
- Query examples:
  - "Show me failures from last week"
  - "Which IPs sent the most email in November?"
  - "Find reports from Google with high failure rates"
  - "Compare compliance this month vs last month"
- NLP to structured query translation
- Suggestions/autocomplete
- Save frequent queries
- Share queries with team

#### 4.5 Predictive Analytics

**Context**: Reactive security is always behind. Predicting compliance trends helps teams address issues before they become critical.

**User Story**: As a security manager, I want to see predictions of future compliance trends so that I can proactively address potential issues.

**Scope**:
- Predictions:
  - Compliance trajectory
  - Volume forecasting
  - Risk scoring for new sources
- Time horizon: 7-30 days
- Confidence intervals
- Factors influencing prediction
- Scenario modeling ("if we add this sender...")
