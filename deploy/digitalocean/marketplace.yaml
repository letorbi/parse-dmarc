  ## What is Parse DMARC?

  Parse DMARC is a lightweight, self-hosted solution for monitoring DMARC
  (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) reports.
  When you enable DMARC on your domain, email providers like Gmail, Outlook,
  and Yahoo send aggregate reports showing who's sending email claiming to
  be from your domain.

  ## Features

  - **Auto-fetch**: Automatically fetches reports from any IMAP inbox
  - **Beautiful Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and visualizations
  - **Lightweight**: Single 14MB binary, no external databases required
  - **Prometheus Metrics**: Built-in monitoring and alerting
  - **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes
  - **DNS Generator**: Built-in tool to generate DMARC DNS records

  ## Getting Started

  After creating your Droplet:

  1. SSH into your Droplet
  2. Edit the configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/parse-dmarc/config.json
     ```
  3. Add your IMAP credentials:
     - host: Your IMAP server (e.g., imap.gmail.com)
     - username: Your email address
     - password: Your email password or app password
  4. Restart the service:
     ```
     sudo systemctl restart parse-dmarc
     ```
  5. Access the dashboard at http://your-droplet-ip:8080

  ## Requirements

  - An email inbox where you receive DMARC reports
